2. Describe the approach you used to implement Dijkstra's algorithm.  This should include a description of the data structures you used and if they come from STL, your own implementation, or other (such as the provided Locator Heap).




3. Describe another approach which could be used to implement Dijkstra's algorithm.  For instance, this could include a contrast between storing flags such as "visited" in an auxillary structure as opposed to inside the vertex.




4. Give an example of using an STL data structure such as map or unordered_map to store and access auxillary data used in Dijkstra's algorithm.
